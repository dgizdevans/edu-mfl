Some exercises as part of a machine learning course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-foundations-for-product-managers/)

This is my first git project which contains part of the course project “Prediction of the Output Power of a Combined Cycle Power Plant” for AI Product Management Specialization by Duke University on Coursera. 
This project contains some basic analysis using Python Pandas and data modeling using Python Scikit-learn.
